Preparation
===========

In this chapter, we firstly learn to start up Raspberry Pi.

Depending on the different devices you use, you can start up the
Raspberry Pi in different methods. We have two situations: having a
screen or no screen, and you can refer to relevant tutorials
respectively. If your Raspberry Pi is set up, you can skip the chapter
and go into the next chapter.
