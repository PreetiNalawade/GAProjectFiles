Download the Code
=================

Change directory to */home/pi*

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/

.. note:: 
    cd, short for change directory is to change to the intended
    directory from the current path. Informally, here is to go to the path
    */home/pi/.*

Clone the repository from github (C code and python code)

.. note::
    git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/SunFounder_SensorKit_for_RPi2

The advantage of this method is that, you can download the latest code
any time you want, and then place the code under the path */home/pi/*.
But in case of incorrect typing which is possible especially when you're
strange to the commands, you can just enter *github.com/sunfounder* at
the address bar of a web browser, and on the page directed find the code
for Sensor Kit.

Now you can start the experiments. Let's rock!
