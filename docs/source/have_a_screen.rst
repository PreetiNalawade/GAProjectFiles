Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step 1**

To download NOOBS from your PC, you can choose **NOOBS** or **NOOBS LITE
-** the only difference is that there is a built-in offline Raspberry Pi
OS installer in **NOOBS**, while the **NOOBS LITE** can only be operated
online. Here, you are suggested to use the former.

Here is the download address of Noobs:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/

**Step 2**

Plug in the Micro SD reader and format the Micro SD card with the SD
Formatter (https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/index.html). If
there are some important files in the Micro SD card, please backup them
first.

**Step 3**

Next, you will need to extract the files from the NOOBS zip archive you
downloaded from the Raspberry Pi website.

-  Find the downloaded archive — by default, it should be in your
   Downloads folder.

-  Double-click on it to extract the files, and keep the resulting
   Explorer/Finder window open.

Finally Select all the files in the NOOBS folder and copy them to the SD
card.

**Step 4**

All the files transferred, the SD card pops up.

**Step 5**

Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi. In addition, connect the
screen, and mouse to it. Finally power up the Raspberry Pi with a power
adapter.

**Step 6**

It will go to the NOOBS interface after starting up. If you use NOOBS
LITE, you need to select Wi-Fi networks (w) first. Tick the checkbox of
the Raspbian and click Install in the top left corner. The NOOBS will
help to conduct the installation automatically. This process will take a
few minutes.
